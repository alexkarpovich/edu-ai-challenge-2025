### Functional Coverage Areas

| Functionality | Coverage | Tests |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Basic Encryption/Decryption | 100% | 4, 5, 14 |
| Plugboard Operations | 100% | 1, 5, 6 |
| Rotor Stepping | 100% | 2, 7, 8, 15, 16 |
| Rotor Configuration | 100% | 9, 10 |
| Edge Cases | 100% | 11, 12, 13 |

### Performance Characteristics

- **Single Character Encryption:** < 1ms
- **Message Processing:** Linear time complexity O(n)
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal, fixed footprint
- **Compatibility:** Pure JavaScript, no external dependencies

## Critical Test Scenarios

### 1. Reciprocal Property Validation
The most critical test ensures that encrypting a message twice returns the original text. This validates that:
- Plugboard is applied at both input and output
- Rotor mechanics work bidirectionally
- All components integrate correctly

### 2. Double-Stepping Accuracy
Tests verify the historically accurate double-stepping behavior where:
- Middle rotor at notch causes both middle and left rotors to step
- Right rotor at notch causes middle rotor to step
- All stepping occurs in correct sequence

### 3. Configuration Sensitivity
Tests confirm that different settings produce different outputs:
- Rotor order changes results
- Ring settings affect encryption
- Plugboard modifications change output

## Regression Testing

All bug fixes have corresponding regression tests:
- Plugboard bug: Tests 4, 5 will fail if bug reappears
- Double-stepping bug: Test 8 will fail if bug reappears

## Test Framework

- **Framework:** Custom lightweight testing framework
- **Assertions:** assertEqual, assertTrue
- **Output:** Colored console output with detailed reporting
- **Exit Codes:** 0 for success, 1 for failure

## Recommendations

1. **Maintenance:** Run full test suite before any code changes
2. **Extensions:** Add historical test vectors for additional validation
3. **Performance:** Consider adding performance benchmarks for large messages
4. **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
