## Features

- üìä **Dual Input Modes**: Accept either known service names (e.g., "Spotify", "Notion") or raw service description text
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent analysis and report generation
- üìù **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates structured markdown reports with 8 key analysis sections
- üíæ **Flexible Output**: Display in console or save to file
- üîí **Secure**: API key management through environment variables

## Report Sections

Each generated report includes:

1. **Brief History** - Founding year, milestones, and evolution timeline
2. **Target Audience** - Primary user segments and demographics  
3. **Core Features** - Top 2-4 key functionalities
4. **Unique Selling Points** - Key differentiators from competitors
5. **Business Model** - Revenue generation strategies
6. **Tech Stack Insights** - Technologies and architecture details
7. **Perceived Strengths** - Main advantages and standout features
8. **Perceived Weaknesses** - Limitations and areas for improvement

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project files to your local machine

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 9
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
   
   **Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your actual API key
   # Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key
   ```
   
   **Option B: Using environment variable**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   
   # Windows
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Analyze a known service:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --service "Spotify"
```

**Analyze custom service description:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --text "A cloud-based project management tool that helps teams organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively using kanban boards and real-time notifications."
```

### Advanced Usage

**Save report to file:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --service "Notion" --output "notion_analysis.md"
```

**Using short flags:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py -s "Slack" -o "slack_report.md"
python service_analyzer.py -t "Your service description" -o "custom_analysis.md"
```

### Getting Help

```bash
python service_analyzer.py --help
```

## Output Examples

The application generates well-formatted markdown reports. Here's what you can expect:

### Console Output
When run without `--output` flag, the report is displayed directly in the terminal with clear formatting and emojis for better readability.

### File Output  
When using `--output filename.md`, the report is saved to the specified file and a preview is shown in the console.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found"**
- Make sure you've set up your API key correctly (see Installation step 4)
- Verify your .env file is in the same directory as the script
- Check that your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**"Error during analysis: ..."**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and active
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

**Import errors**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
- Make sure you're using Python 3.7 or higher

### API Key Security

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit your actual API key to version control**
- Use the `.env` file approach for local development
- For production environments, use secure environment variable management
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` patterns

## Examples

See `sample_outputs.md` for detailed examples of actual application runs and their outputs.
