## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. It sometimes radiates to the neck and rates a 6/10 in intensity. There are no accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other systemic signs. The patient recently recovered from the flu but denies recent injuries, drug use, smoking, or significant alcohol consumption. Family history is notable for the patient's father, who suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient significant concern about having a heart attack as well. The clinician acknowledges the patient's fears, plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate heart function, and advises the patient not to worry excessively while awaiting results.
